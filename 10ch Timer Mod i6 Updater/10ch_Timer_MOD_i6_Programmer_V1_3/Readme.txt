Timer & RSSI Update by qba667 16/11/2016 
Updater by Benbojangles

Folder includes:
- .exe updater containing qba667 firmware
- .hex file

The mods are:
(16/11/2016)
Added names for telemetry sensors with IDs 4-F. Can be changed before flashing at address FA70 for sensor 0x4 each sensor name (8 bytes for name 0 termination needed). Also other sensors names can be changed.
Custom format method for telemetry added starting at FB6C. Just edit and compile attached asm file ane replace bytes from FB6C in original file.

Patched firmware now is able to display additional sensors, formats correctly units for RSSI, Noise and SNR.

FW image from 1800-fac2 so can be flashed with updater.

Please note that addresses I am using in my comments are relative to full FW (so with boot-loader). Published file can be use with serial flasher so it doesn't have boot-loader all offsets are -0x1800. So if I am speaking about FB6C in attached FW is located at E36C (FB6C - 1800).
