Updater created by Benbojangles 24/12/2015

Here is an Alternate Programmer that has the Original Flysky i6 Firmware
It is based on the RClogger updater

It was created after I had problems with a bricked i6 which I could not return to original firmware using
original flysky updater exe. 

If you have similar problems try this updater

It works!
