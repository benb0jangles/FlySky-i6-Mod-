ch 9 & 10 bug fix

tried with a FS-IA10 receiver and get 10 channels of servos

combinations of switches to work for Aux 5 to 10. So now as well as selecting "None", "Vr A" or"Vr B" and"Sw A" to "Sw D", 
you can also select "Sw A+B", "Sw B+C", "Sw C+D" or "Sw A+D". Gives you lots of choice for multiposition flight modes or other things.

Bug fix: fix for the mix crash problem

also contains the external battery sensor code I had been working on. The revised RX Battery page lets you set:

The sensor - Internal (default) or External (uses first iBus voltage sensor CVT01)
The cells type - NiMH (default) or LiPo
The cell count - (defaults to 4) 
The Low level - Bottom level of battery symbol & causes the fast beep alarm
The Alarm Level - Causes the slow beep alarm
The High Level - Top level of battery symbol

OK moves between items.
Up and Down modify an item.
Cancel exits without change.
Long Cancel exits with save.
Long OK sets default values (based on cell type and count).
