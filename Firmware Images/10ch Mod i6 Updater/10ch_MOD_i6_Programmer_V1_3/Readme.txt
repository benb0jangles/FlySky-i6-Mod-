ch 9 & 10 bug fix

tried with a FS-IA10 receiver and get 10 channels of servos

combinations of switches to work for Aux 5 to 10. So now as well as selecting "None", "Vr A" or"Vr B" and"Sw A" to "Sw D", 
you can also select "Sw A+B", "Sw B+C", "Sw C+D" or "Sw A+D". Gives you lots of choice for multiposition flight modes or other things.
